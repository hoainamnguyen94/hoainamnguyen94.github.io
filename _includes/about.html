            <p class="paragraph-text justify-text">
                I am currently a fifth-year PhD student in Statistics at Rice University. 
I am fortunate to be jointly advised by Prof. Marek Kimmel from Rice and Dr. Wenyi Wang from MD Anderson Cancer Center. 
Before coming to Rice, I spent a few years in the UK, working towards a BSc in Mathematics at Imperial College London and an MPhil in Finance at University of Cambridge.

I often describe myself as "50% statistician, 30% mathematician and 20% computer scientist". 
Part of my research focuses on the use of statistical/mathematical models (e.g. branching process) to model population dynamics in biology. 
One example is the progression of cancer cells in malignant tumors. 
I am also interested in the combination of modern statistical and computational tools to tackle "big data" problems in biomedical science. 
I am developing a Bayesian semi-parametric joint model, capable of modeling multiple primary cancers as well as competing risks from multiple cancer types, for accurate personalized cancer risk prediction.
